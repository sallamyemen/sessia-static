                For all the partners that didn’t have the chance to join the travel qualification for Singapore, you have the opportunity to do so in December. Become a Sapphire, stay qualified until May and participate in the voyage.
            </div><br>
            <div>
                At the same time, if during September-November you joined qualification and earned QB and NQB, then these points will also count towards qualification. A reminder that the points of December’s Sapphires and higher will be doubled in January.
                Also, a reminder that your personal points (QB) during the qualification period should total 12.
                <br><br>
                We get them through the following ranks:<br> <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pearl - 1 point</li>
                    <li>Sapphire - 2 points,</li>
                    <li>Ruby - 3 points,</li>
                    <li>Emerald - 4 points,</li>
                    <li>Diamond - 5 points</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                New qualifying points (NQB) is the total number of points of your first line qualifying partners, when they qualify a certain rank for their first time during the qualifying period using the following calculation:<br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Topaz - 1 point</li>
                    <li>Pearls - 2 points</li>
                    <li>Sapphire - 3 points,</li>
                    <li>Ruby - 4 points</li>
                    <li>Emerald - 5 points</li>
                    <li>Diamond - 6 points</li>
                </ul><br>
                NQB should total 20 points (if two partners are participating, then 25 NQB).
