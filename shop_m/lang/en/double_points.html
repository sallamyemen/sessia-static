                In December, reach or confirm your top rank in 2021 (not lower than Sapphire) and double your January points to qualify for the trip to Singapore. <br> <br>
                For example, in December you reach your top rank of Ruby and receive 3 qualifying points (QB) and in your first line two partners reach the Pearl rank for the first time, so you get 4 new qualifying points (NQB).<br> <br>
                In January, you become a Ruby and your points double, so you receive 6 qualifying points (QB), as for your two partners in the first line, who qualify as Pearls for the first time, you get 8 new qualifying points (NQB).
