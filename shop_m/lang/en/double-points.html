                Are you dreaming of an unforgettable trip to exotic Singapore? You’re now one step closer to your cherished goal! In December, you have the chance to significantly increase the number of points necessary to fulfill the conditions of the Voyage promotion:<br><br>
                <b>The CV of December orders that are counted towards SV, NGV, GV6 and the growth of GV6 will be increased by 50%.</b><br><br>
                For example: your December recruit decided to join the “Booster +” program and to participate in the “Celebrate to the fullest” offer. They make an order for 500 CV in December, and they will be credited SV and GV6 (a first line recruit’s CV has these two indicators) of 500 + 500*50% = 750 CV!
                <br><br>
                In the promotion we use three notions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sponsor Volume (SV): this is the sum of personal purchases CV and the CV of first line recruits, who were signed during the qualification period. 1 SV = 1 CV.</li>
                    <li>New Group Volume (NGV): this is the sum of first line organization recruits CV (not counting the personal purchases of the recruits themselves). 1 NGV = 1 CV.</li>
                    <li>Group Volume 6 (GV6): this is the total personal group volume (PGV) and personal group volumes of Senior Consultants of the first-sixth levels (taking into account the compression of Senior Consultants by level).</li>
                </ul>
