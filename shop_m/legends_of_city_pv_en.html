                Would you like to see your portrait on a billboard downtown? Motivate the maximum amount of your first line partners to buy a booster!<br><br>
                Three regional groups are participating in the promotion:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Russia, the CIS</li>
                    <li>Vietnam</li>
                    <li>Europe, Ukraine</li>
                </ul>
                One winner will be determined in each group and their photo will be placed on a billboard in their city for one month.
                <br><br>
                The winner will be the partner who, by the end of May, will have the most regular boosters (475 CV) in their first line. If you succeed in completing the promotion for two projects - Project V and COFFEECELL - your portrait will also decorate the Freedom Group office for an entire month. A nice bonus: the photo session will be organized at the company’s expense in the winner’s region.
