        <p>
            In general, we only collect information that allows us to provide you with our Services at the highest level. This includes, in particular, performing simple actions, for example, allowing other users to see your profile: your name, photo, phone number, email that you’ll choose to show. It also helps us protect our Services from fraudulent activity and spam, and gives us a unique understanding of what additional services may be useful to achieve all of the goals set out in this Policy below.
        </p>
        <div class="privacy__title">Application Area</div>
        <p>
            By using our Services, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure and storage of your personal data and other information by us. You can rest assured that we will only use your information in the manner described in this Policy.
        </p>
        <div class="privacy__title">The Information that We Collect</div>
        <p>
            Registration and account data.<br>
            When using our Services, you voluntarily provide us with personal information, e.g. your name, email address, date of birth, age, phone number, and are therefore not an anonymous user for us. This also means that your name, photo, phone number and email address (if you choose to provide them) will be visible to other users. When installing the application, you will also be prompted to provide access to your mobile device’s address book. On our servers we gather and store only the phone numbers and names of all your contacts (regardless of whether they use Kicksback or not) to provide a connection between you and your contacts.
        </p>
        <div class="privacy__title">Information about Actions</div>
        <p>
            When using Kicksback, we will track, and other users will be able to see, information about the rating and status of the companies subscribed to Kicksback. We will also receive and display information about the posts that you liked, your comments and the purchases made through our shopping service.
        </p>
        <div class="privacy__title">Information from Other Sources</div>
        <p>
            The information that we collect can be combined with information from external sources (such as demographic data and additional contact information), which we’ve acquired legally.
        </p>
        <div class="privacy__title">Additional Information</div>
        <p>
            We can collect additional information, when you access the app through a specific device, e.g., the unique identifier of your mobile device, information about its model and operating system.
        </p>
        <div class="privacy__title">Use and Storage</div>
        <p>
            Our mission is to constantly improve our Services and offer new opportunities to you. As part of this task, we may use the information you provide to:

We may use your information to prevent, detect and investigate fraud, security breaches, potentially prohibited or illegal activities, to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property. The information may include URLs specified in messages that other users have flagged as SPAM or otherwise deemed objectionable, and set by the operating system's authentication services. We reserve the right to use automated systems to block accounts based on such information as well as the policies we have created to protect legitimate users and prevent further information leaks. If your account has been blocked, please contact Support. We may use your information and your activity data to comply with applicable laws.

        <div class="privacy__title">Data Storage:</div>
        <p>
            Unless otherwise stated, we retain information for as long as is necessary and relevant to us in order to achieve the above objectives or to comply with our legal data protection obligations. After you deactivate your account, we will retain the minimum amount of data about you that we are required to keep in accordance with the law or other legal requirements.

In this case, we will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the terms of this Policy, with respect to your personal information, are complied with by the new combined legal entity or other entity. If your personal information was intended to be used for other purposes, we will require the new organization to send you advance notice.

        <p>
            When you register on our Application, we ask for your provisional consent to the use of cookies and tracking technologies. We offer certain features that are only available with the use of tracking technologies. We use in-session tracking technologies and continuous tracking technologies. Tracking technologies (such as cookies) can be permanent (i.e. the files they use remain on your computer until they are deleted) or temporary (i.e. the files are only saved until you close your browser or quit the Application). You can always opt out of the use of tracking technologies if your browser supports such a possibility, although in such case you may experience difficulties using the Application and the Website. We recommend that you consult the user manual for your browser, browser add-ons or installed applications for instructions on blocking, removing or disabling tracking technologies such as cookies. Kicksback uses secure and encrypted tracking technologies so that only we can interpret the information they collect.
