            <div class="doc__bold-text">INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.</div>

          </li>
          <li>

Merchant can also select a minimum kicks balance and Sessia will automatically process Merchant’s purchase of additional kicks when needed.</p>
            <ul class="doc__list-sessia">
              <li>Topping up does not mean that Sessia sold any product or service to Merchant but means that Merchant just uploaded money into its Sessia Wallet. Merchant shall have the right to withdraw any part of the proceeds or money in its Sessia account in the same way deposited LESS commissions payable to Sessia as follows: (i) for bank wire transfer the commission is 2%; (ii) for debit card return 4%; and (iii) for cryptocurrency return 0.5%.</li>
              <li>For the avoidance of any doubt, Sessia does not act as a credit card or payment processing agent or servicer between Merchant and End Customer. When an End Customer purchases goods, merchandise, or services, the End Customer pays Merchant directly to each Merchant’s designated merchant account via credit card, debit card, other fiat, or cryptocurrency pursuant to Merchant’s own instructions and policies. Sessia is not responsible for or engaged on behalf of any Merchant, business, or other person in the collection of payments for purchases of any goods, merchandise, or services by any End Customer, or other customer or client.</li>
              <li>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Merchant's Sessia account balance is too low and has insufficient funds to pay Cashbacks and/or kickbacks to the End Customers and his/her/it referrals that have also transacted with the Merchant through Sessia, the underlying purchase won't go through (i.e., be declined), and the Merchant will have to top up its Sessia account to reprocess the transaction and award Cashbacks and kickbacks.</li>
              <li>The Sessia platform enables Merchant to designate four (4) levels of access and control of Merchant’s Sessia account to Merchant’s employees, workers and representatives as follows:
                <div class="doc__ul-sessia"><span class="doc__ul-li-sessia">“Editor” – An Editor may only edit the products, text descriptions and content in the Sessia Online Store, as set forth in Section 12 below. An Editor is not authorized to allocate Cashbacks or kickbacks to End Customers and other users.</span>
                  <div class="doc__ul-sessia"><span class="doc__ul-li-sessia">Cashier” - Cashier has the right to allocate and approve Cashbacks and kickbacks to End Customers and other users.</span></div>
                  <div class="doc__ul-sessia"><span class="doc__ul-li-sessia">“Merchant Admin” – A Merchant Admin has the rights of an Editor and Cashier, and can grant access to any of Merchant’s employees, workers and representatives.</span></div>
                  <div class="doc__ul-sessia"><span class="doc__ul-li-sessia"> “View” – An employee, worker, and representative may view only Merchant’s content (and the same content available to other Sessia users and users) but has no authority to change or perform any tasks as an Editor, Cashier or Admin.</span></div>
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>Merchant shall be responsible for submitting accurate employee personnel profiles of all Editors, Cashier, and Merchant Admin, without the omission or misrepresentation of any material information that adversely bears on the employee’s honesty or ability to transact business through Sessia without engaging in any fraud or other deceptive trade practices.</li>
              <li>Merchant is solely responsible for ensuring that it’s conducting transactions, including the awarding of Cashbacks and kickbacks to End Customers, in the form of cryptocurrency that is authorized and not prohibited in the nation(s) and jurisdiction(s) in which Merchant conducts business.  Merchant shall be solely responsible for indemnifying, defending, and holding harmless Sessia, and all of its beneficiaries and officials, for all for any claims, causes of action, or liability arising from any cryptocurrency transactions that are in violation of any law of any nation or jurisdiction.  Merchant shall have sole discretion and responsibility in determining whether it shall accept payments from the End Customer in the form of cryptocurrency or any other method of payment.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="doc__bold-text">DISSEMINATION OF KICKBACKS TO END CUSTOMERS.</div>
            <p>When an End Customer makes a purchase through the Sessia App or platform, Merchant’s cashier first scans the Sessia QR-code (quick response code) of the End Customer from his or her smartphone. On the cashier’s screen, the cashier will see the name of the End Customer. The cashier then scans the QR Code on the check (or takes a picture thereof if the check does not have a QR code) and verifies the correct price before approving the transaction. Once Merchant’s cashier approves the transaction, only the End Customer, and not the Merchant, can take the picture of the receipt (whether paid by check, card, or cryptocurrency) and check (if applicable, with account information redacted), which Sessia publishes instantly and automatically on Sessia’s internal feed (the “Sessia Social Feed”) where the End Customer’s friends, contacts, and other Sessia users can see it. The End Customer (and not the Merchant) may thereafter also post a picture and other information of the product purchased. The End Customer’s friends, followers, and other Sessia’s users can comment, like, or share the post on other social media platforms to generate referrals to that Merchant and kickbacks to the original End Customer.</p>
            <ul class="doc__list-sessia">
              <li>Upon each transaction the End Customer makes through Sessia, the End Customer will automatically receive Merchant’s available Cashbacks in the form of kicks. In addition, the End Customer will automatically receive kickbacks disbursed from Merchant’s Sessia Wallet but only after the End Customer’s followers and friends make purchases from the same Merchant subsequent to seeing and responding to the End Customer’s purchase on the Sessia Social Feed.</li>
              <li>As a condition precedent to a Merchant's issuance of any kickbacks: (i) the End Customer must make an actual purchase from that Merchant through Sessia; (ii) and Sessia must confirm that the follower or user has seen the End Customer's transaction receipt or check published on the "Sessia Social Feed". Sessia recognizes who has seen an End Customer’s post by his/her/its followers or friends engaging in one of the following tasks: (i) clicking a “like”; (iii) clicking on the check Icon on the right hand side of the banner; (iii) writing or posting comments; or (iv) “flipping the banners. Any of these four tasks enables Sessia to confirm that the friend, follower, or other user is transacting with Merchant in response to the original End Customer’s purchase from that Merchant. It is at that point only, that Merchant is obligated to reward the kickbacks to the End Customer.</li>
              <li>Effect of Refund Policies and Erroneous Merchant Charges - End Customers will not receive their kickbacks until the expiration of the period a customer or client is eligible for a refund of any returned good, product, or merchandise pursuant to Merchant’s Return/Refund policy as disclosed on Merchant’s Online Store, as set forth in Paragraph 12 and Paragraph 14 below. On the other hand, in the event, Merchant erroneously overcharges an End Customer that results in Merchant’s issuance of excessive kicks, Sessia will not be able to reverse the transaction, and Merchant is hereby responsible for indemnifying, defending, and holding harmless Sessia, and all of its beneficiaries and officials, for all for any claims, causes of action, or liability between the Merchant and End User arising from any such overcharge or over-issuance of kickbacks.</li>
              <li>Sessia has the right to display and maintain a rating system for each End customer, based on their purchases and activity in the application. Sessia is entitled at its discretion to create, change and delete a rating system and methodologies using which Sessia rates each End customer compared to other End Customers on the Sessia platform and appoint increasing or decreasing coefficient for each Final client applied to the cashback or kickback base rate depending on the rating of the End customer. The Merchant agrees to pay cashbacks and kickbacks taking into account the rating and not to dispute the results of ratings, including that in court.</li>
              <li>The User has the right to request cashback payment from the Merchant via the Sessia platform. To do this, the User using the cashback request  function indicates the name of the Merchant and uploads to the platform a receipt of the completed purchase from the Merchant. Identification of the ownership of the check is determined by the TIN, indicated on the check. The merchant must consider the application within 14 (fourteen) calendar days, approve or refuse it, indicating reason. At the time of approval of the application, the requested amount will be debited from the Merchant’s Wallet and credited to the User’s Wallet. The User whose request was rejected has the right to re-request cashback by providing additional proof of purchase.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="doc__bold-text">Commissions Payable to Sessia.</div>
            <p>Sessia will be adding its 20% commission on the Cashbacks and kickbacks. For example, if Merchant wants to pay kickbacks to an End Customer in the amount of 5% of the purchase price, Sessia will subtract from Merchant’s Sessia Wallet: (5% times (X) 1.20%) which is 6%.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="doc__bold-text">SETTING UP CASHBACKS AND KICKBACKS SYSTEMS.</div>
            <p>On the Sessia platform, Merchant will have the option to email Sessia requesting set up of different rates of Cashbacks for their various or types of goods, merchandise, and services (by way of example only, a restaurant may want to pay higher Cashbacks on alcohol and exotic dishes and lower Cashbacks on basic dishes or services). Merchants will in real time be able to keep their Cashbacks and rebates on the Sessia platform up-to-date with their changing menus and offerings. In addition, Merchant will be able to reward each initial End Customer kickbacks on the purchases by their friends, followers, and referrals for up to five (5) levels from their original referral, by way of example as follows:</p>
            <ul class="doc__list-sessia">
              <li>End Customer #1 make a purchase at a global chain coffee merchant. End Customer # 2 sees an electronic copy the check or receipt of that purchase (redacted for personal identifiable information) reflecting that End Customer #1 made a purchase at that Merchant. Upon liking End Customer #1’s post on the Sessia Social Feed, End Customer #2 is designated as End Customer #1’s first level whereby each time End Customer #2 makes a purchase at that coffee merchant, End Customer #1 will receive kickbacks designated by that Merchant. Next, if End Customer #3 likes End Customer’s #2 purchase via the Sessia Social Feed, End Customer #3’s purchase will trigger kickbacks to both End Customer #1 and End Customer #2, and so on for up to a maximum at End Customer #6. Merchant may reduce the amount of the kickbacks for each End Customer further removed from that purchasing End Customer (i.e., the kickbacks from End Customer #3’s purchase will be less for End Customer #1 than for End Customer #2).</li>
              <li>Merchant shall solely be responsible to learn, discover, investigate, comply, abide by all Applicable Law it is country or jurisdiction in connection with the awarding of any kickbacks through Sessia. Merchant shall be solely responsible for indemnifying, defending, and holding harmless Sessia, and all of its owners and officers, for all for any claims, causes of action, or liability arising from Merchant’s violation, infringement, contravention of Applicable Law under Section 9 and this Section 11.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="doc__bold-text">Rules for Online Store.</div>
            <p>Merchant shall be invited to set up its online store through Sessia for End Customers, End Customer’s friends, family, referrals, and other prospective customers. In furtherance thereof, Merchant shall be enabled to create folders and categories on Sessia’s platform for Merchant’s goods, services, products, and other merchandise, and have the option to upload any and all such goods services, products, and other merchandise purchased through by the End Customer.</p>
            <ul class="doc__list-sessia">
              <li>It is each Merchant’s responsibility to source, sell, and fulfill only authentic products. Prohibited products include bootlegs, fakes, or pirated copies of products or content; products that have been illegally replicated, reproduced, or manufactured; and products that infringe another party’s intellectual property rights.

If Merchant sells or supplies inauthentic goods, Merchant may immediately suspend, revoke, cancel, or terminate Merchant’s Sessia online store and accounts (and any related accounts) and destroy and/or remove advertisement of any inauthentic products in our fulfillment centers at Merchant’s expense.Merchant shall be solely responsible for indemnifying, defending, and holding harmless Sessia, and all of its owners and officers, for all for any claims, causes of action, or liability arising from any (i) misrepresentations uploaded or posted by Merchant on its online store with Sessia; or (ii) delivery of any fake, inauthentic, replica, or counterfeit goods, products, and merchandise.
