As a condition prior to the issuance by the Merchant of any kickbacks, the User must make an actual purchase from that Merchant. Sessia is an intermediary between the Merchant and the User. The terms of the privilege program of a particular Merchant can be found by the User on the Merchant’s website or in the relevant section of the Sessia application. The terms of the Project V and Coffecell Privilege Program are contained in Appendix No. 1 and No. 2 to this User Agreement. </li>

              Prohibited Fraudulent Behavior on the Sessia Platform. Sessia undertakes not to deceive its users regarding cashbacks or kickbacks that should be rightfully provided to them. Hereby, a user is prohibited from engaging in inauthentic behavior on the Sessia network or anywhere else on the Sessia platform, which includes creating, managing or otherwise maintaining fake accounts; creating accounts under fake names; creating accounts that are or may be participating in fraud; creating multiple accounts that are used to do any of the following: (i) mislead people about the origin of content; (ii) mislead people about the destination of links from the Sessia services (for example, by providing a display URL that does not match the destination URL); (iii) mislead people by trying to encourage shares, likes or clicks; (iv) mislead people in order to cover up or allow a breach of other terms of this User Agreement. In addition to the foregoing, each User is prohibited from changing his/her profile from the original User account associated with the purchase to another User or otherwise creating another Sessia account that can bypass, redirect, transfer kickbacks from the legitimate original purchase user to another user. (Just an example: A User must not create a second Sessia account that results in kickbacks generated from that User's purchase of coffee from a gourmet store and redirected to their family member who made the original purchase from that store through Sessia.) If a User is found to be involved in the above fraudulent behavior, Sessia has the right to immediately terminate and revoke the User's account/subscription, and the User will forfeit the monetary value of any and all kickbacks in that User's account at the time that the Agreement is terminated, as well as other forms of refunds and compensation from Sessia.

Sessia will, without prior notice to the offending User and at its sole discretion, remove all objectionable content, and shall further have the right to immediately terminate the User's account/subscription. The violating User will also be deprived of all cashbacks and kickbacks on his account.

          In order to avoid any doubts, only the User can take a photo of the receipt and / or receipt of the transaction and authorize its publication on the Sessia social network, and not the Merchant. Sessia takes the privacy of its merchants and users very seriously. The User hereby agrees that Sessia will only collect, use and share your information to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, and in particular as follows: <br>

          Sessia will collect data about you in the course of maintaining records of your membership and use of the Sessia application, the Sessia platform, as part of the normal administration process of Sessia;<br>

          Providing and managing the services you have requested, including but not limited to managing your Sessia account; <br>

          Finally, in the event of a change in control of Sessia's operations (whether through a merger, sale or other transaction), sale or transfer of its assets, User information, which may include your Personal Information (defined below), may be disclosed to the potential buyer under a retention agreement or may be sold or transferred as part of this transaction.
          In order to avoid any doubts, Sessia will not display on its Social Network or on any other page of its platform any User's bank or credit card information or taxpayer identification number (TIN) ("User Confidential Information"). Likewise, for any receipt or check issued to any User and displayed on the Sessia social network, all street addresses (other than city, region and country), bank account numbers, credit/debit card numbers must be unambiguously and completely edited by Sessia prior to display. Merchants and Users on the Sessia platform will also see how much the User spends, what transactions they enter into, as well as the goods, services and products purchased by the User. Sessia grants each Merchant the right to access a User's calendar to the extent that said User has uploaded or granted Sessia access to their Calendar on the Sessia platform to effectively organize face-to-face meetings or online communications between a Merchant and another User.

Any refund must be made through the Merchant or its payment processing account to the User's own bank account or credit card. <br> In addition to the foregoing, Users will not receive their kickbacks until the end of the period during which the customer is entitled to a refund for any returned item, product or other product, in accordance with the terms of the return of the Merchant.

    <p>
      The Project V Privilege Program is an efficient and simple bonus accrual system developed by Sessia software. The company's deductions for the payment of bonuses amount to 56% of the turnover, not counting special bonuses and promotions. In addition, partners have the opportunity to purchase products with a 40% discount and sell them to the consumers, thereby increasing their income.
    </p>
    <p>The Project V Privilege Program is a balanced payout system based on the following types of income generation:
    </p>
    <ol class="privacy__ol-blue">
      <li><span> Retail bonus</span></li>
      <li><span> Referral bonus</span></li>
      <li><span> Partner cashback</span></li>
      <li><span>Partner bonus</span></li>
      <li><span> Kickback</span></li>
      <li><span> Leader bonus</span></li>
      <li><span> StarMaker bonus</span></li>
      <li><span> Jump bonus</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p>In addition to Project V Privilege Program payments, there are special incentive programs:</p>
    <ol class="privacy__ol-blue" start="9">
      <li><span>Booster</span></li>
      <li><span> Volume Booster</span></li>
      <li><span>Gift CV</span></li>
      <li><span>Freedom International Group Loyalty Program</span></li>
      <li><span> Freedom International Group Auto-Program (launching in September 2022)</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p>In order to explain the Project V Privilege Program, let us explain some of the definitions that we will see later.</p>
    <div class="privacy__title privacy__title_blue" style="padding: 30px 0 10px 0; font-weight: 600;  font-size:18px;">DEFINITIONS </div>
    <p>CV (Commission Volume): </p>
    <p>CV - a special unit of trade. All terms of the Privilege Program are expressed in CV terms.</p>
    <p>Each product has its own number of points, the CV base. The CV base of products is the same in all countries, which allows for the unification of the Project V Privilege Program and to do international business in any country open to Project V with a unified Privilege Program for all countries (for the time being, business is being done in 17 countries).</p>
    <p>Each product’s CV base is indicated in the Project V store on the Sessia mobile application for each product.</p>
    <p>The CV base serves as the basis for accruing the Company’s partner bonuses.</p>
    <p>Personal Volume (PV) is the sum of CV orders placed per month by the partner themself and/or their clients who placed an order using his Partner Code through the Company's online store  <a href="https://projectvint.ru" target="_blank">https://projectvint.ru</a>. or the Sessia mobile application.  </p>
    <p>Personal Group Volume (PGV) is the sum of the Personal Volumes (including their own PV) of partners in the partner organization, excluding the personal volumes of partners with the rank of Senior Partner and their organizations (see the description of partner ranks below).</p>
    <div class="privacy__title privacy__title_blue" style="padding: 30px 0 10px 0; font-weight: 600;  font-size:18px;">SPONSORSHIP</div>
    <p>A sponsor is a partner who invites other partners to their organization. Your sponsor is the person who invited you to Project V.<br>
      For partners invited by you or your partners, you become a sponsor, and they form your organization.</p>
    <p>Partners that you personally invited are your first line (1st level). In turn, the partners who were invited by the partners of your first line are your second line (2nd level), and so on.
      Organizations that start with your first line partners are Branches of your organization.
      <br>
      The partner who invited you is your first level sponsor. In turn, the partner who invited your sponsor is your second level sponsor, and so on.
      All your sponsors shape your sponsorship vertical.

    </p>
    <div class="privacy__title privacy__title_blue" style="padding: 30px 0 10px 0; font-weight: 600;  font-size:18px;">DYNAMIC COMPRESSION </div>
    <p>Dynamic compression is the principle of calculating partner rewards and qualifications.<br>
      To calculate the qualifications for the Project V Career Plan and partner remuneration for blocks 2-3, a Compression Tree is built.
     <br> To do so:  </p>
    <ol class="privacy__ol-blue">
      <li><span> All partners with the rank of Senior Partner are determined.</span></li>
      <li><span> In the Compression Tree, the PV of partners with a rank below the Senior Partner are included in the PGV of the Senior Partner (the PGV of each Senior Partner is calculated this way).</span></li>
      <li><span>The Senior Partner (with their PGV) is "pulled up" to the higher sponsor - the Senior Partner (i.e. is placed at their 1st level in the Compression Tree).</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Based on the resulting Compression Tree, levels and qualifications are calculated, with partner rewards calculated in accordance with the percentages and levels of a particular bonus. </p>
    <ol class="privacy__ol-blue header-ol">
      <li class="privacy__title privacy__title_blue"> RETAIL BONUS
        <div>(CALCULATED BASED ON THE PRODUCT’S RETAIL PRICE)</div>
        <p>When you buy  products as a partner of the Company, you get a wholesale discount of up to 40%. The difference between the wholesale price you pay and the price your customers pay is your retail bonus. The retail price is always indicated on our official website <a href="https://projectvint.ru" target="_blank">https://projectvint.ru</a>. </p>
        <p>The minimum affiliate order is 47.5 CV. When placing such an order, your discount will be up to 20%. In order to use the Privilege Program, you must be registered on the Sessia application.
  <br>
          If you already have an order of 47.5 CV in a given month, you can additionally purchase an arbitrary number of products for an arbitrary amount of CV.
          <br>
          By increasing your order, you increase your discount. With a monthly total of orders of 95 CV or above, your discount will be up to 30%, and with a monthly total of orders of 190 CV or above, your discount will be up to 40%.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="privacy__title privacy__title_blue"> REFERRAL BONUS
        (CALCULATED BASED ON THE PRODUCT’S RETAIL PRICE)

        <p>To sell products to your customers, you can use our website <a href="https://projectvint.ru" target="_blank">https://projectvint.ru</a>or our mobile application Sessia. </p>
        <p>In this case, you will not need to personally deliver the products to your customers. Using your Partner Code, the Company will deliver the order to them, and you will automatically receive a reward in the form of a Referral Bonus in the amount of 20 to 40% of the client's product value.<br>
          That is, you can independently place an order for your client, or they can place it for themselves, and for such an order you are credited with a Referral bonus.<br>
          The Referral bonus is calculated as a percentage of the sum of client orders. The percentage depends on the partner’s rank.<br>Referral bonus matrix</p>

        <p>The launch of the Auto-Program is planned for 2022.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="privacy__title privacy__title_blue">PROJECT V PRIVILEGE PROGRAM - CAREER PLAN
        <p>The Company's career plan is based on the basic VIP (Very Important Person) qualification.<br>

          The career plan is based on two notions:<br>

          “Being in the qualification” which means to have a structure that meets the given qualification requirements in the current month. The Leader bonus is accrued to all partners who were in the VIP 1S qualification and above during the given month.
          <br>
          “To close a qualification” ​​which means to maintain a structure corresponding to a given qualification for a certain period of time assigned to each qualification.
          <br>
          Upon closing a qualification, the partner receives a special insignia corresponding to his closed qualification. The insignia is awarded at a special solemn recognition procedure at the Company’s events.
          <br>
          To get the Jump bonus, it is necessary “to close qualification.” To get the other bonuses, it is necessary “to be in a certain qualification” during the month being calculated.
          <br> Privileged client<br>
          If the sum of your orders (and your clients' orders) per month is 47.5 CV or more (i.e. your Personal Group Volume is 47.5 CV or more), you get the Privileged client status. As a Privileged client, you get to buy products with a discount of up to 20%, and also receive a 20% Referral Bonus from your customers' orders.
          <br>Partner<br>
          If the monthly sum of your orders (and the orders of your clients) is 95 CV or more (i.e. your Personal Volume is 95 CV or more), you get the Partner status.<br>
          As a Partner, you get to buy products with a discount of up to 30% and receive a 30% Referral Bonus from your customers' orders. You also receive Cashback from the orders that you bought at the price of a Privileged Client.<br>
          You can achieve Partner status not only through your personal orders and the orders of your customers. If your PV is 47.5 CV or more and your Personal Group Volume (PGV) is 95 CV or more, you will also become a Partner.<br>
          In this case, you receive Cashback and the Referral Bonus, as well as a Partner Bonus from the orders of your Privileged Clients, which is the difference between the Partner and the Privileged Client price.<br>
          Senior partner<br>
          If the monthly sum of your orders (and the orders of your clients) is 190 CV or more (i.e. your Personal Volume is 190 CV or more), you get the Senior Partner status.<br>
          As a Senior Partner, you buy products with a discount of up to 40% and receive a 40% Referral bonus from your customers' orders. You also receive Cashback from the orders that you bought at the price of a Privileged Client or Partner.<br>
          You can achieve the status of a Senior Partner not only through your personal orders and the orders of your customers. If your PV is 47.5 CV or more and your Personal Group Volume (PGV) is 190 CV or more, you also become a Senior Partner.<br>
          In this case, you receive Cashback and the Referral bonus, as well as receive a Partner bonus from the orders of your Privileged Clients and Partners, which is the difference between Senior Partner price and Privileged Client/Partner price.
          Having reached the status of a Senior Partner, you qualify for the 2nd block of the Project V Privilege Program:<br>
          The senior partner receives Kickback in the amount of 5% from the PGV of the senior partners of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth levels.<br>
          The purpose of this bonus is to attract new partners. In the event that a partner violates the privileges program (in particular, creates a fake account), the Company reserves the right to unilaterally terminate the contract with the partner and block their account.

    <p>
      The Coffeecell Privilege Program is an efficient and simple bonus accrual system developed by the Sessia software. The company's deductions for the payment of bonuses amount to 60% of the turnover, not taking into account the special bonuses and promotions. In addition, partners have the opportunity to purchase products with a 20% discount and sell them to the consumer, thereby increasing their income.
<br><br>
      The Coffeecell Privilege Program is a balanced system of payments that is based on the following ways of earning income:
    </p>
    <ol class="privacy__ol-green">
      <li><span> Partner discount</span></li>
      <li><span> Partner cashback</span></li>
      <li><span> Kickback</span></li>
      <li><span> Gift CV (booster)</span></li>
      <li><span> Topaz Plus</span></li>
      <li><span> Business Cashback</span></li>
    </ol>

    <p>In addition to the Coffeecell Privilege Program payouts, there are special incentive programs:
    </p>
    <ol class="privacy__ol-green" start="7">
      <li><span> The Freedom International Group loyalty program</span></li>
      <li><span> The Freedom International Group Auto-Program (to be launched in September 2022)</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p>In order to explain the Coffeecell Privilege Program, let's explain some definitions that we will come across hereinafter.</p>
    <div class="privacy__title privacy__title_green" style="font-size: 14px;"> DEFINITIONS </div>
    <p>
      <b>CV (Commission Volume)</b><br>
      CV - is a special unit of trade. All terms of the Privilege Program are expressed in CV terms.<br>
      Each product has its own number of points, the CV base. The products’ CV base is the same in all countries, which allows us to unify the Coffeecell Privilege Program and to conduct international business in any open Coffeecell country with a single Privilege Program for all countries (currently operating in 17 countries).<br>
      Each product’s CV base is indicated in the Coffeecell store on the Sessia mobile application for each product.<br><br>
      The CV base serves as the base for the accrual of the Company’s partner bonuses
      Personal Volume (PV) is the sum of CV orders made per month by the partner and/or their clients who placed an order using their Partner Code through the Company's online store <a href="https://coffeecell.com/ " target="_blank">https://coffeecell.com/ </a>or in the Sessia mobile application.
      <br>
      Booster CVs will be credited to your gift account and you can use them to purchase Coffeecell products. You can choose a gift for the accumulated amount when placing your next order. At the same time, it is not obligatory to immediately use the gift CVs; you can continue to accumulate them in your gift account.
    </p>
    <div class="privacy__title privacy__title_green" style="font-size: 14px;">SPONSORSHIP </div>
    <p>
      A sponsor is a partner who invites other partners into their organization. Your sponsor is the person that invited you to Coffeecell.<br>
      You become the sponsor to the partners whom you or your partners invite and they form your organization.<br>
      The partners that you personally invited are your first line (1st level). In turn, the partners who were invited by the partners of your first line are your second line (2nd level), and so on.<br>
      Organizations that are started by the partners of your first line are Branches of your organization.<br>
      The partner who invited you is your first level sponsor. In turn, the partner who invited your sponsor is your second level sponsor, and so on.
      All of your sponsors make up your Sponsor Vertical.<br><br>
      Business case is a set of Coffeecell products that must be purchased in order to become a member of the Privilege Program. <br>
      The minimal price of acquired Coffeecell products to participate in the Privilege Program is 6 000 CV.<br>

      Activity is the minimum monthly amount of acquired Coffeecell products that is required to remain a member of the Privilege Program.<br>

      To confirm Activity is to make monthly purchases of Coffeecell products on the <a href="https://coffeecell.com/ " target="_blank">https://coffeecell.com/</a> website or in the Sessia application. The minimal amount of purchases required to confirm activity is 6 000 CV each month.
    </p>

    <ol class="privacy__ol-green header-ol">
      <li>Partner discount
        <p>When you buy any Coffeecell products as a partner of the Company, you get a 20% discount.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Partner cashback<p>If your partners, who are first line partners in your organization and have not yet purchased a Business Case, purchase Coffeecell products, you will receive 20% from each of their purchases.</p></li>
      <li>Kickback<p>After obtaining the Business Case, you begin to earn a percentage on the purchases of your partners in all four lines of your organization, who themselves have a Business Case. This means that you accrue Kickback from each purchase that your partner makes.<br>
        The size of your Kickback depends on the line of the partner that makes the purchase.</p>

      <p>Cashback and Kickback accrual and use:<br>
        Cashback and Kickback are accrued based on the cost of the orders in the national currency and are credited to a special individual internal account at the end of the month. Funds from this account can be used to pay for orders in subsequent months.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Booster<p>When placing personal orders in the amount of 15 000 CVs or more during a month, a partner can receive 1 500 gift CVs. With an increase in the amount of the order, the number of gift CVs increases: for every additional 5 000 CVs spent on the purchase of Coffeecell products, the partner receives an additional 500 gift CVs.
        <br>This amount is offset by all orders made during the given month, including the current one. I.e., as soon as the partner's amount of personal orders (PV), including the current one, reaches 15 000 CVs, they immediately receive 1 500 CV. They can be spent immediately or later.<br>
        All unspent CVs are accumulated in the "Gift CV" account and the partner can use them later.</p></li>
      <li>Topaz +<p>When placing personal orders in the amount of 50 000 CVs or more within a month, a partner can receive 5 000 gift CVs. With an increase in the amount of the order, the number of gift CVs increases: for every additional 5 000 CVs spent on the purchase of Coffeecell products, the partner receives an additional 500 gift CVs.
       <br> Further, in each of the following 6 months, the partner has the opportunity to receive an additional 1 500 CV, subject to the following conditions: the partner has purchased a Business Case and confirms their Activity monthly.<br>
        All unspent CVs are accumulated in the "Gift CV" account and the partner can use them later.</p></li>
      <li>Business Cashback<p>Business Cashback is a fixed amount that is credited to you every month when your Organization reaches a certain turnover and performs personal Activity. The amount of Business Cashback depends on your rank (see Coffeecell Career Plan below for more details) and can reach 100 000 USD.</p></li>
      <li>Freedom International Group loyalty program<p>The loyalty program consists of three partner statuses: silver, gold and platinum.<br>
        The loyalty program contains the following conditions for earning points:
      </p>
        <ol>
          <li> <p>1 CV of a Coffeecell order equals 1 point.</p></li>
          <li> <p>1 CV of a recruit order = 1 point for 1 CV of Coffeecell products. A Recruit is defined as a user who has registered on Sessia within the last full 12 months at the time of placing the order, including the month of the order, but not earlier than January 1, 2021.</p></li>

        COFFEECELL PRIVILEGE PROGRAM - CAREER PLAN<br>
        ​​​The Coffeecell Career Plan uses qualifying turnover to determine the partner’s rank and Business Cashback.<br>

        Qualifying turnover is the amount of purchases of your organization, taking into account the 40% rule, which means that no more than 40% of the amount necessary to achieve a certain rank is credited from one Branch. The entire turnover is taken into account ad infinitum.<br>

        There are various qualification ranks, which are discussed in more detail below. Upon reaching any of them, you will receive monthly Business Cashback. The higher your status, the more Business Cashback.<br>
        The partner ranks according to the Coffeecell Career Plan:<br>
        - Topaz<br>
        - Pearl<br>
        - Sapphire<br>
