                            <p>This Privacy Policy (hereinafter referred to as the Policy) is a public offer of the SESSIA LLC Company, duly established in accordance with the laws of the United States, having its registered office at 16192, Coastal Highway, Lewes, Delaware 19958, USA, hereinafter referred to as the “Company,” and defines the procedure for processing and protecting personal information about Users that the Company may receive when Users use the SESSIA platform (hereinafter referred to as SESSIA) and its services, which include mobile applications, websites and other IT solutions (hereinafter referred to as Applications or Services). This Policy is an integral part of the “User Agreement” in the SESSIA applications and/or websites.</p>
                            <p>The specified documents (including any of their parts) can be changed by the Company unilaterally, without any special notification to Users. The new version of the documents comes into force from the moment they are published in the applications and/or on the SESSIA websites unless otherwise provided by new editions of the documents.</p>
                            <p>Using SESSIA’s functionality means that the User has unconditionally consented to this Policy and the conditions for processing their personal information specified therein; in case of disagreement with these conditions, the User must refrain from using the Services and functionality of SESSIA.</p>
                            <p>Generally, we only collect information that allows us to provide you with our Services at the highest level. This includes, among other things, performing simple actions such as allowing other users to see your profile: name, photo, phone number, and email address that you choose to display. It also helps us protect our Services from scams and spam and gives us unique insight into what additional services may be useful to achieve all of the purposes outlined in this Policy below.</p>

This also means that your name, photo, phone number, and email address (if you choose to provide them) will be visible to other users. When you install the Application, you will also be asked to grant access to your mobile device's address book. We only collect and store the phone numbers and names of all your contacts on our servers (whether they use SESSIA or not) to enable communication between you and your contacts.</p>
                            <p>We also ask you to provide passport data in accordance with the terms of the SESSIA User Agreement by sending a scan or copy of your passport by email to <b>info@sessia.com</b> or by uploading a scanned copy of your passport in the SESSIA application if this function is available in the User's country.</p>
