                            <p>When the User makes a purchase (using a credit card), COFFEECELL, in the internal feed of the COFFEECELL Social Network, (i) displays a photo or electronic copy of the receipt, (ii) names the Merchant, and (ii) identifies the item, product or service so that friends, followers, and other COFFEECELL users can view, comment, like and ultimately make purchases from that Merchant.</p>
                            <p>To avoid any doubt, only the User can photograph the receipt and/or transaction receipt and authorize its publication on the COFFEECELL social network, not the Merchant. The company takes the privacy of its merchants and users very seriously. The User hereby agrees that COFFEECELL will collect, use, and transfer your information only to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, and in particular as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>COFFEECELL will collect data about you in the course of maintaining records of your membership and use of the COFFEECELL application, the COFFEECELL platform as part of COFFEECELL's normal administrative processes;</li>
                              <li>Providing and managing the services you have requested, including, but not limited to, managing your COFFEECELL account;</li>
                              <li>Providing an internal social networking platform for the User and other COFFEECELL users, subscriptions to view, like, and comment on items, products, and services;</li>
                              <li>Verifying your identity and verifying the authenticity of personal data;</li>
                              <li>Creating user profiles on our website;</li>
                              <li>Protection against fraud or security threats and other risk management;</li>
                              <li>Communication with the User regarding services that may be of interest;</li>
                              <li>Evaluating and improving our website and other offerings;</li>
                              <li>Adapting our services and otherwise improving the quality of customer service;</li>
                              <li>Satisfying legal or regulatory or law enforcement requirements, etc.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Disclosure of information to law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties will be made only to the extent required by law and when the Company, in good faith believes that such disclosure is necessary to protect the rights of the Company and/or comply with legal processes, court orders, regulations, or other legal processes.</p>
                            <p>Finally, in the event of a change in control of the Company (whether through a merger, sale, or other transaction), sale or transfer of its assets, User information, which may include your Personal Information (defined below), may be disclosed to a potential buyer under a confidentiality retention agreement or may be sold or transferred as part of this transaction.</p>
                            <p>To avoid any doubt, the Company will not display on its Social Network or any other page of its platform any of the User's bank or credit card information or taxpayer identification number (TIN) ("User’s Confidential Information"). Likewise, for any receipt or check issued to any User and displayed on the COFFEECELL social network, all street addresses (except city, region, and country), bank account numbers, and credit/debit card numbers must be uniquely and completely edited by COFFEECELL before display.</p>
                            <p>Merchants and Users on the COFFEECELL platform will also see how much the User spends, what transactions they enter into, as well as the goods, services, and products purchased by the User. COFFEECELL grants each Merchant the right to access the User's Calendar to the extent that said User has uploaded or provided COFFEECELL with access to their Calendar on the COFFEECELL Platform to effectively facilitate in-person meetings or online communications between the Merchant and another User.</p>
