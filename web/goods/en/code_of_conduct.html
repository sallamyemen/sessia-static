During this time, the Partner loses the rights to all operating privileges without exception and does not have the right to sign new Partners. The partner is deprived of the right to purchase and receive rewards and gifts and is denied access to the Company’s applications. Within 10 days from this moment, the Partner must contact the Company to clarify the situation.</p>
