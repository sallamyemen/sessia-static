    <p>
      In general, we only collect information that allows us to provide you with our best Services. This includes, for example, simple tasks like allowing other users to see your profile - the name, picture, phone number, email you choose to show. It also helps us to keep our Services clear of fraud and spam, and it allows us to get a unique understanding of what additional services may be useful to you, and all other purposes set out in this policy below.
    </p>
    <div class="privacy__title">SCOPE AND CONSENT</div>
    <p>
      By using our Services, you allow us to collect, use, disclose, and retain your personal information and other information but we will never read or listen to the content you are sharing privately. You can be sure that we will only use your information as described in this Policy.
    </p>
    <div class="privacy__title">INFORMATION WE COLLECT</div>
    <p>
      Registration and Account Information
      When you use our various Services you voluntarily give us personal information (e.g., name, email, birth date, age, phone number) and you are not anonymous to us. That means your name, photo, phone number, and email address (if you choose to provide them) will be visible to other users. When you install the App, you’ll also be asked to allow us access to your mobile device’s address book. A copy of the phone numbers and names of all your contacts (whether they’re Sessia members or not – but only name and phone number) will be collected and stored on our servers in order for us to be able to enable you and your contacts to connect. We also ask you to provide us with your ID details, in accordance with the terms of the Sessia User Agreement, by sending a scanned copy of your ID to
      <a class="privacy__link" href="mailto:info@sessia.com">info@sessia.com</a>  or by downloading a scanned copy of your ID in the Sessia App, if this function is available in the user's country.
